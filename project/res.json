Dockett, 34, missed last year with a torn ACL and is now dealing with an injury involving his rib cartilage that he sustained on Saturday in a preseason loss at Denver.  The 49ers had envisioned Dockett as a pass-rush specialist in their nickel defense, but their glut of capable defensive linemen might have made him expendable.  Jim Tomsula is expected to find more opportunities for young players to play meaningful regular-season snaps than his predecessor, Jim Harbaugh, did during the previous four seasons.  Dockett\u2019s release likely creates a larger role for rookie defensive tackle Arik Armstead, whom the 49ers selected No. 17 overall.  In the offseason, Tomsula has placed an emphasis on his players using social media responsibly and having a broad, team-oriented perspective when posting messages and pictures.  Joe Looney started the first two preseason games at right guard, but he won\u2019t be starting the regular season with the 49ers.  The 49ers released Looney, a fourth-round pick who was the final member of the seven-man 2012 draft class still on the team.  Looney got the first chance to serve as the starting right guard this summer, but he was replaced by rookie sixth-round pick Ian Silberman for the third preseason game in Denver.  Looney\u2019s release suggests the 49ers could retain Silberman, guard Brandon Thomas and guard/center Dillon Farrell, who is the only remaining offensive lineman on the roster with extensive experience at center Starting center Daniel Kilgore is on the physically unable to perform list and will miss at least the first six games.  The 49ers will likely keep Jasquiski Tartt (rookie second-round pick); Jimmie Ward (2014 first-round pick) and L.J. McCray (2014 undrafted free agent) to serve as backups to Eric Reid and Antoine Bethea.  The 49ers announced they\u2019ve released two undrafted rookies, wide receiver Issac Blakeney and offensive tackle Patrick Miller."}

Romney and President Obama on climate change is deafening,&quot; said Erich Pica, president of the environmental group Friends of the Earth Action.  Nine environmental groups circulated petitions asking journalist Jim Lehrer, the moderator of Wednesday's debate, to press the candidates on global warming.  [...] he eventually backed out of a multistate plan to limit greenhouse gas levels through the use of a cap-and-trade system, in which power plants buy and sell permits to emit those gases.  His economic stimulus package in 2009 steered billions of dollars to companies building solar power plants or wind farms that generate electricity without greenhouse gases.  A recent poll by researchers at George Mason University and Yale University found that 65 percent of undecided voters believe humans are causing global warming, the same percentage as among likely Obama voters.  [...] 61 percent of undecided voters in the poll said climate change would be one of the issues they would consider when casting their vote.  &quot;Obama's political handlers are telling him that people in the middle of the spectrum - independents - are likely to be alienated when he says 'global warming' and 'climate change,' &quot; said Edward Maibach, director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason.

Sitting means no moving around to make way for riders with bikes or babies, or struggling to maintain balance while grabbing a pole or a strap or a fellow rider.  Sitting also means personal space on train cars that often fill up with so-called crush loads.  BART cars have nearly 60 seats, but, during rush hour, more than 100 people crowd in.  Commute trains headed for the Transbay Tube are typically jammed by the time they reach the Embarcadero and Montgomery stations.  Gauri Joshi, 31, whose ride home from San Francisco to Fremont takes 50 minutes, estimates that her chances of sitting jump from nearly zero to 70 percent by retreating two stops, from Montgomery to Civic Center.  Fernanda Costa, 57, rides back to Civic Center from Embarcadero, where the platform and the trains are sometimes so packed that she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even get on a train, much less sit down for her 45-minute ride to Union City.  According to BART, there were an average of 441,000 trips each weekday in October.
